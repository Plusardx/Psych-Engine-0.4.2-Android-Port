:dad:ENOUGH-
:bf:Wait, hold that thought bomb man.
:bf:I was given something by someone to read out when this happens.
:bf:Alright...
:bf:"Yo. This is Kappa Nerd speakin'."
:bf:"Ya know, the main creator of this mod."
:bf:"Anyway, I'm here to pull a Vs. Matt V.2.1 here."
:bf:"I just want to say thank you."
:bf:"This mod became more than just a mod to me, personally."
:bf:"It became a passion project."
:bf:"I saw so much support for this mod when I first released it that.."
:bf:"I just felt like I NEEDED to make a Week 2 for it."
:bf:"HELL! I even planned a Week 3 and Week 4 where you get to play AS Whitty."
:bf:"I had so many plans for this mod. So many great ideas I wanted to add."
:bf:"But unfortantly, only Week 2 will happen."
:bf:"Weeks 3 and 4 I cancelled a couple weeks ago."
:bf:"This was a choice by ME! No one told me to do this."
:bf:"After an influx of mods having/relating to Whitty have gotten rid of him-"
:bf:"I became anxious and scared that I was gonna receive harassment or some shit."
:bf:"And while I am still preparred for it, no one should expect harassment."
:bf:"So after this, there will be 1 more final update.."
:bf:"Adding all the features me and my team put in for Week 2."
:bf:"'But then what happens after that?' you might ask."
:bf:"I will keep Whitty Remixed up for 1 or 2 months..."
:bf:"Then delete it off of both Gamejolt and Gamebanana."
:bf:"This was a thought that Tyler, one of our charters, had came up with.."
:bf:"And I thought that it was perfect."
:bf:"We would still show off our efforts that we put in this mod."
:bf:"But anyway, with that said. I want to say thanks."
:bf:"Thank you Tyler, Klutch, and Diego for helping me out on this mod."
:bf:"Thank you Sock.clip, KadeDev, NateAnim8, and bbpanzu"
:bf:"For creating such an amazing mod with such an amazing character."
:bf:"And finally, thank 'YOU'."
:bf:"The amount of support for this mod has skyrocketed man, let me tell you."
:bf:"This mod would not be the way it is now without your guys' support."
:bf:"I love you all. Thank you."
:bf:"Maybe if things change regarding to Whitty..."
:bf:"I may come back to this."
:bf:Wow. That was long.
:dad:Kinda heart warming though.
:bf:Wait, there's something else.
:bf:"P.S. Tyler charted Ballistic Remixed soooooo....."
:bf:"The chart's actually like, difficult."
:bf:"Enjoy breakin' your fingers lol."
:bf:Wait what-
